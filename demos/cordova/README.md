# Cordova demo

This is a simple demo which shows how cordova works and what it can do.

Cordova is a framework to make hybrid apps. Currently many platforms are supported like iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows, Firefox OS, Blackberry 10 and more.

On the web you might see Cordova and Phonegap used for the same thing. In short: Cordova is the open-source branch of Phonegap. Phonegap itself is maintained by Adobe (and integrates with their Phonegap Build platform), while Cordova is maintained by the Apache Foundation. Currently the projects are pretty much in sync but you have to decide to use either Cordova or Phonegap in your terminal.

In this demo we are gonna use/demo: 

* NPM
* Yeoman
* Grunt
* Cordova

1. Open terminal here
2. Run command "npm install -g generator-angular-cordova"
3. Run command "yo angular-cordova AwesomeApp"
4. Run command "grunt" to build
5. Run command "grunt serve" for preview
