# Angular - Advanced

This is a bit more advanced than the previous demo, but still nothing highend. It shows the basic elements of Angular and allows for more insight in what it can do

# What?

1. Open terminal here
2. Run command "npm install -g generator-angular"
3. Run command "yo angular myApp"
4. Run command "grunt serve"
5. Watch the awesomeness

Now of course you aren't doing any programming but the essence is clear:

1. Angular looks pretty cool
2. You can do a lot with these generators

# And now?

Angular features lots of topics we haven't covered slightely. It is wise to read up on Angular before you start your first app as it can be easy to make some annoying mistakes. There are many things angular does which are different, so its important to have an idea on what is the Angular way and why it works like this.

Some topics to spend some time on:

* Controllers
* Directives
* Filters
* Providers (Factories, Services, etc)
* Routing
* Scope
* Views
